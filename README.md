# Covid-19 Project
### 1) Project Highlights: <br>
This project uses Covid-19 data to discuss the impact of government reaction on the matter of disease control of New York State. The project first presents a 'Parallel World' which compares the government responses of Wuhan, China and NY State after each area discovered its regional first case. Then, within the U.S., the project further looks at the responses of different parties including WHO, CDC and NY State government. The word clouds shed a light on the change of politicians' attitudes towards the disease. Users of our html can also vision what the situation will be like if the current disease control measure takes place in another time. The final deliverable is an html webpage.

### 3) Code: <br>
<b>Time Series Model.rmd: </b> This code builds a time series model to forecast the confirmed cases of New York State. <br>
<b>Time Series Model Forecast Vis.ipynb: </b> This code builds the visualization of time series model. <br>
<b>COVID-19-SEIR.ipynb: </b> This code builds the SEIR simulation model to simulate the pandemic for New York State.

### 4) Bonus Dataset:
<b>State_Measure_Data-Bonus Dataset.xlsx: </b> This bonus dataset summarises the information we reviewed from news releases and state government websites. The dataset categorises the policies of each state and lists the effective dates of policies  and also the total cases and new cases for each date.
